# Substring-Match
O(nlogn) algorithm for finding the longest common substring of 2 strings
Last Updated: 10/20/15

Use this code to efficiently find the largest matching substring between two strings.
This was an exercise in algorithm design and hashing. 
The algorithm is based on Rabin-Karp rolling hashing, and runs in O(nlogn) time, where n is the length of the strings.
Instructions:
Where str2 and str1 are the strings of interest, call:
largest_substring_match(str2, str1)
